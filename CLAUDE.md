# Voltiris: The Game

Offline-first isometric idle management game (greenhouse + energy) for iOS/Android.
Stack: TypeScript strict, React, Vite, PixiJS, Zustand, Dexie, Vitest, Capacitor.

Full design and phased plan: `Voltiris The Game – Build Plan for Claude Code.md` (repo root).

## Rules

- Game rules live ONLY in packages/sim. No DOM, no React, no Date.now() there.
- The sim is deterministic: seeded RNG saved in state, injected clock.
- Every player action is a Command (UUID + timestamp) handled by the sim.
- Fixed tick = 1 in-game hour = 15 real seconds. Offline catch-up runs ticks in a loop.
- Content (crops, equipment, modules, buildings, events) is data in packages/content.
- GameState is versioned; any change to its shape needs a migration + test.
- Persistence only via the SaveStore interface (local now, cloud later).
- Write Vitest tests for all sim logic. Keep functions small and typed.
- Work on one build-plan phase at a time and stop when its Done-when list passes.

## Commands (run from repo root)

- `npm test` – all Vitest projects (sim, content, mobile)
- `npm run lint` – ESLint (bans Date.now / Math.random / new Date() in packages/sim)
- `npm run typecheck` – tsc in every workspace
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` – Prettier
- `npm run dev` – Vite dev server for apps/mobile
- `npm run build` – production web build to apps/mobile/dist
- `npm run cap:sync -w @voltiris/mobile` – build and copy web assets into android/ and ios/
- `npm run android -w @voltiris/mobile` – build, sync and run on an Android emulator/device

## Notes

- Workspaces import each other's TypeScript source directly (package `exports` point to `src/index.ts`); there is no per-package build.
- TypeScript is pinned to ~6.0 because typescript-eslint does not support 7.x yet.
- The app is landscape-only (AndroidManifest `sensorLandscape`, iOS Info.plist orientations).
